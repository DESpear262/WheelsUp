# Current Work Focus

## Active Work Session
- **Session Start**: Completed dev environment setup task
- **Current Agent**: Task 0.2 Dev Environment Setup - Complete
- **Next Priority**: Task 1.x Data Acquisition (crawler/scraping implementation)

## Current Project State
- **Phase**: Development environment ready (10% complete)
- **Available Tasks**: Data acquisition tasks now available
- **Blockers**: Task list appears incomplete/truncated

## Open Questions
1. **Task List Completeness**: The WheelsUp_MVP_Task_List.md file appears truncated with "... (continues with full expanded tasks from previous message) ...". Is the full task list available elsewhere?

2. **Next Task Priority**: What is the next available task after 0.2? Should I look for Phase 1 data acquisition tasks?

## Next Steps
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Data Acquisition
- Implement crawler/scraping infrastructure
- Set up data pipeline foundations

## Recent Changes
- **Completed Task 0.2 Dev Environment Setup**:
  - Created Dockerfiles for Node.js 22 (web) and Python 3.14 (ETL)
  - Set up docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS, OpenSearch 2.13
  - Configured environment variables (.env.example files)
  - Added docker-compose.override.yml for local development
  - Created verification script and Docker documentation
  - Established service networking and health checks
- **Completed Task 0.1 Repository Initialization**:
  - Created monorepo folder structure (apps/, etl/, infra/, docs/)
  - Added code style configs (ESLint, Prettier, Black, Ruff)
