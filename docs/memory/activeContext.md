# Current Work Focus

## Active Work Session
- **Session Start**: Completed repository initialization task
- **Current Agent**: Task 0.1 Repository Initialization - Complete
- **Next Priority**: Task 0.2 Dev Environment Setup (Docker, docker-compose)

## Current Project State
- **Phase**: Project initialization/setup (5% complete)
- **Available Tasks**: Task 0.2 Dev Environment Setup now available
- **Blockers**: Task list appears incomplete/truncated

## Open Questions
1. **Task List Completeness**: The WheelsUp_MVP_Task_List.md file appears truncated with "... (continues with full expanded tasks from previous message) ...". Is the full task list available elsewhere?

2. **PR Status Clarification**: Only seeing two tasks total (0.1 Complete, 0.2 Open). Are there additional tasks beyond the basic setup phase?

## Next Steps
- Ready to begin Task 0.2: Dev Environment Setup
- Create Docker configuration and docker-compose.yml
- Set up local development environment with containers

## Recent Changes
- **Completed Task 0.1 Repository Initialization**:
  - Created monorepo folder structure (apps/, etl/, infra/, docs/)
  - Added code style configs (ESLint, Prettier, Black, Ruff)
  - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview
  - Set up package.json for Next.js web app
  - Created requirements.txt for ETL pipeline
  - Added Terraform infrastructure scaffolding
  - Included MIT license
- Created docs/memory/ directory structure
- Initialized four core memory bank files with project context

## Active Decisions
- Following memory bank system requirements to create missing core files
- Using PRD as source of truth for initial memory bank content
- Maintaining coordination with multi-agent workflow rules
