# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Flight training is an opaque, high-stakes decision for students. Unlike real estate (where Zillow provides transparency), aviation training lacks:
- Centralized comparison tools
- Standardized pricing information
- Reliable data on training duration and quality
- Easy discovery of nearby flight schools

Students currently spend weeks researching schools individually, calling each one for quotes, and making decisions based on incomplete or outdated information.

### Market Opportunity
- **Flight Training Industry**: $10B+ global market with 100,000+ active pilots in training
- **Student Pain Points**: Information asymmetry, inconsistent pricing, geographic limitations
- **Current Solutions**: Fragmented directories (AOPA, FAA) with minimal comparison features
- **Competitive Landscape**: No dominant player in flight school marketplace space

### User Needs
**For Student Prospects:**
1. Find flight schools within driving distance of major airports
2. Compare total training costs across programs (PPL, IR, CPL)
3. Understand expected training duration and fleet availability
4. Verify school legitimacy and VA eligibility
5. Access transparent pricing without cold-calling schools

**For Flight Schools:**
1. Increased visibility to qualified prospects
2. Reduced administrative overhead from quote requests
3. Data-driven insights about competitive positioning
4. Trust signals through verified data and reviews

### Business Value
**Revenue Model (Post-MVP):**
- Lead generation fees from schools
- Premium listings and verification services
- Partnership deals with training providers
- Data licensing to aviation industry stakeholders

**Trust & Credibility:**
- Complete data provenance and freshness indicators
- LLM-powered extraction with confidence scoring
- Human-verified sample data pre-launch
- Transparent methodology and source attribution

### Product Differentiation
1. **Data Depth**: Comprehensive schema covering costs, duration, fleet, ratings, and VA status
2. **Trust Signals**: Every data point shows "as of" date, source, and extraction confidence
3. **Technical Innovation**: LLM schema extraction from unstructured web content
4. **User Experience**: Map-based discovery, faceted search, and comparison tools
5. **Data Freshness**: Snapshot-based ETL with reproducible, auditable runs

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 30%+ profile click-through rate from search results
- **Data Quality**: 70%+ field completeness, 0.8+ mean confidence scores
- **Market Penetration**: 50%+ of U.S. flight schools indexed
- **Trust Indicators**: 100% of displayed fields show provenance metadata

### Future Roadmap
- Continuous data refresh with diff detection
- School verification and claim flows
